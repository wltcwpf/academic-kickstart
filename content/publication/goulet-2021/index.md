abstract: 'Coseismic surface fault displacement presents a serious potential hazard
  for structures and for lifeline infrastructure. Distributed lifeline infrastructure
  tends to cover large distances and may cross faults in multiple locations, especially
  in active tectonic regions like California. However, fault displacement measurements
  for engineering applications are quite sparse, rendering the development of predictive
  models extremely difficult and fraught with large uncertainties. Detailed fault
  surface rupture mapping products exist for a few documented cases, but they may
  not capture the full width of ground deformations that are likely to impact distributed
  infrastructure. The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence presented an ideal opportunity
  to collect data and evaluate the ability of different techniques to capture coseismic
  deformations on and near the fault ruptures. Both the M 6.5 and 7.1 events ruptured
  the surface in sparsely populated desert areas where little vegetation is present
  to obscure surficial features. Two study areas (~400 m × 500 m each) around the
  surface ruptures from the two events were selected. Teams of researchers were deployed
  and coordinated to gather data in three ways: field measurements and photographs,
  imagery from small uninhabited aerial systems, and imagery from airborne light detection
  and ranging. Each of these techniques requires different amounts of resources in
  terms of cost, labor, and time associated with the data collection, processing,
  and interpretation efforts. This article presents the data collection methods used
  for the two study areas, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the results
  interpretations. While all three techniques capture the key features that are important
  for displacement design of distributed infrastructure, the use of remote sensing
  methods in combination with field measurements presents an advantage over the use
  of any single technique.'
