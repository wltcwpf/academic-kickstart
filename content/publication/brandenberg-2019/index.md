abstract: Following the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, consisting of an M 6.4 foreshock
  and M 7.1 mainshock along with many other events, the Geotechnical Extreme Events
  Reconnaissance association deployed a team to gather perishable data. The team focused
  their efforts on documenting ground deformations including surface fault rupture
  south of the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, and liquefaction features in
  Trona and Argus. The team published a report within two weeks of the M 7.1 mainshock.
  This article presents data products gathered by the team, which are now published
  and publicly accessible. The data products presented herein include ground‐based
  observations using Global Positioning System trackers, digital cameras, and hand‐measuring
  devices, as well as unmanned aerial vehicle‐based imaging products using Structure
  from Motion to create point clouds and digital surface models. The article describes
  the data products, as well as tools available for interacting with the products.
