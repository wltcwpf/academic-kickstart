abstract: 'We present a database and analyze ground motions recorded during three
  events that occurred as part of the July 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence: a
  moment magnitude (M) 6.5 foreshock on a left‐lateral cross fault in the Salt Wells
  Valley fault zone, an M 5.5 foreshock in the Paxton Ranch fault zone, and the M 7.1
  mainshock, also occurring in the Paxton Ranch fault zone. We collected and uniformly
  processed 1483 three‐component recordings from an array of 824 sensors spanning
  10 seismographic networks. We developed site metadata using available data and multiple
  models for the time‐averaged shear‐wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30) and for
  basin depth terms. We processed ground motions using Next Generation Attenuation
  (NGA) procedures and computed intensity measures including spectral acceleration
  at a number of oscillator periods and inelastic response spectra. We compared elastic
  and inelastic response spectra to seismic design spectra in building codes to evaluate
  the damage potential of the ground motions at spatially distributed sites. Residuals
  of the observed spectral accelerations relative to the NGA‐West2 ground‐motion models
  (GMMs) show good average agreement between observations and model predictions (event
  terms between about −0.3 and 0.5 for peak ground acceleration to 5 s). The average
  attenuation with distance is also well captured by the empirical NGA‐West2 GMMs,
  although azimuthal variations in attenuation were observed that are not captured
  by the GMMs. An analysis considering directivity and fault‐slip heterogeneity for
  the M 7.1 event demonstrates that the dispersion in the near‐source ground‐motion
  residuals can be reduced.'
