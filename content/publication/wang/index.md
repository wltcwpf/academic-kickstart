abstract: "We derive non-ergodic site response for California sites using an expanded version of the NGA-West2 database. We then investigate the degree to which different site response analysis methods capture observations. An ergodic site term provides a baseline against which other models are compared. Here we emphasize site-specific ground response analysis for sites with in situ VS measurements. We describe the assignment of damping to individual soil layers using geotechnical models and site-specific spectral amplitude decay parameter ÔÅ´. We provide data-model comparisons for cases in which ground response analyses provide variable levels of effectiveness."
