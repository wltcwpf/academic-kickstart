abstract: Although multimodality has been widely studied in the literature, planning
  and operating bus lanes in congested urban city centers are still challenging topics
  for researchers and policy makers. Most existing approaches lack quantitative methods
  for estimating the impact of bus lanes or for optimizing the operation of bus lanes
  at a system level. This paper proposes a novel optimization approach for allocating
  road space to bus lanes in cities. The approach determines the optimal space share
  between the modes in service and allocates the bus lanes by integrating strategies
  that lead to less total travel cost. By relying on recent advances in network-level
  traffic flow modeling, namely, the multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (mMFD),
  the approach captures multimodal traffic dynamics and travel costs by mode. The
  impact of a bus lane on mode usage is taken into account to aggregated mode shift
  phenomena under changes in layout of dedicated bus lanes. Simulation was performed
  in a Swiss city network to test the proposed optimization approach. The research
  found that (a) the mMFD could be properly integrated to decide for road space optimization
  of large-scale multimodal urban networks, (b) an optimal and efficient space share
  minimized the total travel cost for all users, and (c) the best strategy for the
  studied network was to implement the allocated space on the connected links on a
  corridor rather than to assign them sparsely to the links that are heavily congested.
