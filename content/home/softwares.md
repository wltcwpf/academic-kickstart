  description = "A project created on the Designsafe. It provides a Jupyter Notebook that interacts with the HVSR database to perform two operations that are anticipated to be useful for research of site response effects in which HVSR is used for site characterization: 1) identify if a site has HVSR peaks; and 2) for sites where peaks are present, establish attributes of the peaks such as peak frequency and amplitude."
